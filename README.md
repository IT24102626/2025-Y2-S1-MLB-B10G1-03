# Heart Disease Prediction Using Clinical Features

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and preventive measures can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of severe complications. Machine Learning provides powerful tools to analyze clinical data and predict the likelihood of heart disease, enabling better healthcare decision-making.

Objective- Predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease based on their clinical features and medical history.

Type of Task-Binary Classification (Supervised Learning)

# How to Run the Code

1)Download the dataset (heart.csv) from the above link or use the provided file.                                                                                                
2)Download the .ipynb notebook file and upload it to Google Colab.                                                                                                                          
3)Select a GPU runtime (optional, but recommended for faster training).                                                                                                    
4)Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
